0.29

fixed AUR module

fixed Mandriva module

fixed a problem with openBSD URL construction

added new Slackware module to replace the previous one which queried a now-defunct (third party) web interface

code cleanup

implemented functionality suggested by Guillaume Delacour and Steve Cotton

updated to current version numbers of Ubuntu, Mandriva, openSUSE, OpenBSD, Fedora, Slackware (13.1 not 13.37 as we're waiting on linuxpackages.net to update their search interface)

NB: Fedora and openSUSE seem currently not to be working; Mandriva shows only first ten results returned by sophie.zarb.org


0.24

Cygwin module added

other modules updated

repository column widened to accommodate huge openSUSE repo strings

other minor changes and fixes


0.23

columns have been made wider to accommodate Debian's often excessively long version strings

netbsd, debian and ubuntu now report sizes

netbsd now reports dates

"--shallow" suppresses these fetches, which can be desirable as they are time-consuming and exert server load

all of these calls are threaded by default, can be disabled by "--no-threads" (same procedure as every year, James)

fixed fedora size formatting bug

now warns if distros specified are not recognised (thanks S Cotton for the bug report)

now honours proxies (thanks Thibaut Varene for the bug report, Jonathan Wiltshire for pointing out the fix)

Mandriva module added (thanks Sylvestre Ledru for pointing out the server)


0.22

netbsd module now queries pkgsrc.se, shows more details, is faster

Miscellaneous bugfixes

Also using the old combos subroutine again for some repositories, is slower

Added manpages in English and German, updated install script to install manpages to /usr/share/man


0.21

Added back Gentoo

Added back Fedora

Changed combos subroutine after profiling showed it to be slow

Including Debian "testing" repositories since we've been including Sourcemage's "test" for a while

Officially no more dependency on wget (for now, at least)


0.20

Distributions can now be specified on commandline, using the "-d Distribution1,Distribution2" option; the recognised strings are archlinux, debian, fink, freebsd, macports, netbsd, openbsd, opensuse, slackware, sourcemage, ubuntu
